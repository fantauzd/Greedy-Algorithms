# Problem: You have a list of assignments [A, B, C, D]. You are provided with the time that it takes to solve these assignments, timetaken[t1, t2, t3, t4] and the deadline of each of the assignment, deadline[d1, d2, d3, d4].
#
# Where t1 corresponds to the time taken to complete Assignment A, which is due on d1.
#
# Your goal is to complete the assignments in such a way that you minimize the total lateness for the assignments. You need to return the minimum (Maximum lateness).
#
# Assume units for timetaken and deadline are days.
#
# For example:
#
# If assignments = [A, B, C, D]; timetaken=[1, 2, 3, 4] and deadline=[2,4,5,7].
