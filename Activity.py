# You are given a list of activities {a1, a2,...an} with their start times [s1, s2,...sn]
# and end times [e1,e2,....en].
#
# Example: activities: {Play Golf, Paint, Cook, Sleep, Jog, Write Code, Eat}
#
# start times: [1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8]
#
# end times: [3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 9, 9]

# You are equally interested in all of them. Your goal is to maximize
# the number of activities that you can perform. You cannot choose overlapping activities,
# for example, 'cook' and 'paint'. You can choose activities that immediately start
# after the previous one ends, for example, 'Play Golf' and 'Paint'.
