# You are a pet store owner, and you own few dogs. Each dog has a specific hunger level given
# by array hunger_level [1..n] (ith dog has hunger level of hunger_level [i]). You have couple of
# dog biscuits of size given by biscuit_size [1â€¦m]. Your goal to satisfy maximum number of
# hungry dogs. You need to find the number of dogs we can satisfy.
# If a dog has hunger hunger_level[i], it can be satisfied only by taking a biscuit of size
# biscuit_size [j] >= hunger_level [i] (i.e biscuit size should be greater than or equal to hunger
# level to satisfy a dog.)
# If no dog can be satisfied return 0.
# Conditions:
# You cannot give same biscuit to two dogs.
# Each dog can get only one biscuit.
